## Instructions

This is the Matching Game. Can you match all the cards to each other? How fast and in how few of moves can you acheive this?

HOW TO PLAY:

1) Once the page is loaded start clicking cards.
2) When you have a match the cards will turn yellow. This designates a complete match.
3) Once all cards have been matched you will receive a victory popup detailing your time of completion, star (difficulty rating), and number of moves taken for victory.

Difficulty:

20 moves or less: Congrats! You've completed HARD mode. You're the cream of the crop.

21 - 30 moves: Good Job! You're average. You completed it, but can do better I'm sure!

Over 30 moves: Ouch! Keep trying! You can do better!
